# In-Progress Project: Climate Control System with ESP32, DHT22, and Fuzzy Logic Library

Welcome to the repository for the In-Progress Climate Control System project using ESP32, DHT22, and the Fuzzy Logic Library! In this ongoing project, we are working on creating a system that will allow for the automatic control and regulation of climatic conditions in a specific environment using electronic components and fuzzy logic techniques.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to design and build a climate control system that can monitor ambient temperature and humidity using a DHT22 sensor and make intelligent decisions to maintain these conditions within a desired range. To achieve this, we are utilizing an ESP32, a powerful development platform that provides us access to the required connectivity and processing capabilities.

## Main Components

### ESP32

The ESP32 is a development platform based on Espressif's ESP32 chip, which combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity with a powerful dual-core processor. We are using this component to collect data from the DHT22 sensor, process the information, and make decisions based on fuzzy logic to control devices such as fans, air conditioners, and heaters, among others.

### DHT22 Sensor

The DHT22 sensor is a device capable of measuring ambient temperature and relative humidity. It is an essential component for our system, as it provides the necessary data to assess the current climatic conditions and compare them with target values.

### Fuzzy Logic Library

Fuzzy logic is a technique that allows dealing with uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making. In this project, we are utilizing a fuzzy logic library to evaluate climatic conditions and adjust control devices accordingly. This will enable us to create a system that can adapt and make intelligent decisions in a variable environment.

## Current Project Status

Currently, we are in the initial development phase. We have set up communication between the ESP32 and the DHT22 sensor to collect temperature and humidity data. We have also started exploring the implementation of fuzzy logic to make preliminary decisions based on the collected data.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to our project! If you're interested in participating, you can do so in the following ways:

- Assisting with the implementation of fuzzy logic for decision-making.
- Collaborating on the control interface to adjust target values and observe the system's behavior.
- Testing and providing feedback on the system's performance under different environmental conditions.

## Final Notes

This repository is a constantly evolving space where we will share the progress and advancements of our Climate Control System project. As we continue to develop and enhance the system, we will update the documentation and code to reflect the changes made.

Thank you for your interest in our project! If you have any questions, suggestions, or wish to collaborate, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us through the provided tools in this repository.
